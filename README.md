# javascript_quiz

My JavaScript Quiz was made as an NBA trivia quiz. Upon turning in the project I realized that having this coding quiz be coding based was part of the criteria.
Originally I thought that I could create a quiz on something of my interest, so I apologize for making it about basketball. 

My quiz works through JavaScript that will cycle through a random list of questions and give users 60 seconds to finish.
When users select a wrong answer the time left will decrease by 10 seconds.
When users finish the quiz or when the timer is up users will be able to submit their name and save their name and restart the quiz.

Challenges:

I am able to save scores to local storage but I have a hard time displaying the scores upon refreshing the page since I am appending child.
I think that has something to do with JSON stringify/parse but I could not figure that piece out in time. 
Additionally I have a bug where if users reclick the right answer it will increase their score. I did not get the right score event to correlate on the next button.

Overall this was a very challenging project, but I feel good about my little quiz app and hope I can improve it and add it as a profile piece as I learn more and get more familiar with JavaScript.
